# Banana Collector Project Report

### Project Details

### Learning Algorithm

Type algorihhm pseudocode here

Reward functions etc

Type of Network used

Parameters

    Include a GIF and/or link to a YouTube video of your trained agent!
    Solve the environment in fewer than 1800 episodes!
    Write a blog post explaining the project and your implementation!
    Implement a double DQN, a dueling DQN, and/or prioritized experience replay!
    For an extra challenge after passing this project, try to train an agent from raw pixels! Check out (Optional) Challenge: Learning from Pixels in the classroom for more details.



### Training Process Plots



#### We also trained the agent with Double Q method

The agent was able to solve the environment but it took a lot longer than with Dueling.

![Double Q Training took 1008 episodes](outputs/DoubleQ_training_plot.png)
    Environment solved in 1008 episodes!	Average Score: 13.00
    --- Training took 1005.5937979221344 seconds ---

### Ideas for Future Work

There has been a lot of advancements lately in the field of DRL. Few interesting ideas to try include Prioritised Experience Replay and Rainbow. 
Try implementing Open AI best practices [openai/baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines) to see if, or how much the algorithm can be improved.
